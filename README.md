# o COVIDTracker App <br />
Application Goal:<br />
This application was built in order to track the covid cases around the world. <br />
During this pandemic we saw people with lack of information about COVID-19 and their statistics. So basically we decided to build an application to keep people updated on the world’s statistics and cases live. <br />
It is live data from WHO updated every seconds from their APIs. <br />
# o	Project Description: 

•	The project retrieves live data from APIs and store them into a table (Saved Data Tab). The application retrieves the live data of the total of confirmed cases around the world and as well it displays the percentage of recovery and the number of active, recovered, death, critical states and total number of affected countries on the main page at the moment the user enters the application or each time they wish to refresh the data. User will also be able to navigate to the next tab and search every single country around the world or their own country by clicking on the country name and a drop down menu will appear for them to chose the country they wish to see the data and where it would display the total number of confirmed cases as well as active, recovered, deaths, critical and total tests and test per million. User will be able to refresh their Live Data by pulling down the screen and the loading will be initiated, and this will refresh the Live Data in the application. User will be able to access another tab for Saved Data. The Saved Data Tab basically pulls all the Live Data from the API and stores it into a table for the user. User will also be able to change the background color of the application by using the Theme button which will be available on every screen for easy access (each time theme button is pressed snackbar will appear to notify background color has been changed). . User will be able to save their signature in the application in the setting tab and as well select their default reply actions for emailing (will be saved with Sharedpreference even after the application is closed). User will also have the chance to send us feedback on issues they are having with the application for us to update and improve the application. Once user clicks on submit a prompt asking for permission to collect data from device will appear once user agrees it will open their default email application, they are using such as GMAIL to submit/send their feedback email to us. Application will also support English and French.
