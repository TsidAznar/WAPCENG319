# o COVIDTracker App <br />
This application was built in order to track the covid cases around the world. <br />
Since USA was the center of attention with all the infected and active cases, a section for the states in USA was created in order to track the number of cases registered everyday.<br />
It is live data from WHO updated every seconds from their APIs. <br />
# o	Project Description: 

•	The project retrieves live data from APIs and store them into a database. The application retrieves the live data of the total of confirmed cases around the world and as well it displays the percentage of recovery and the number of active, recovered, death, critical states and total number of affected countries on the main page at the moment the user enters the application or each time they wish to refresh the data. User will also be able to navigate to the next tab and search every single country around the world or their own country where it would display the total number of confirmed cases as well as active, recovered, deaths, critical and total tests and test per million. There will be also another tab available to be able to search all the states in USA as they were recently the leading country and we wanted to target that in order to show how accurate the application is. User will be able to save their signature in the application in the setting tab and as well select their default reply actions for emailing. User will also have the chance to send us feedback on issues they are having with the application for us to update and improve the application. Application will also support English and French.
